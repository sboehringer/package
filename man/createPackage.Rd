\title{Create package from vector of source files and single configuration}
\usage{
createPackage(packageDesc, packagesDir = "~/src/Rpackages", dir = NULL,
  doInstall = FALSE, gitOptions = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{packageDesc}{path to the configuration file (R, extended plist format, json, yaml).
If an R-file is provided, it is sourced in a seperate environment and needs to define the variable
`packageDefinition`. This variable has to be a list which is further specified in the details below.
If a propertyList/JSON/YAML-file is provided, they have to parse into a list corresponding to
`packageDefinition`. Functions \code{propertyFromStringExt}, \code{read_json}, and \code{read_yaml} are
used for parsing, coming from packages \code{package}, \code{jsonlite}, and \code{yaml}.}

\item{doInstall}{flag to indicate whether the package should also be installed}

\item{packageDir}{folder in which the folder structure of the package is written}
}
\description{
This function creates a package dir, runs documentation generation using roxygen and optionally installs the package. It can also update via git and manage version numbers. In a minimal configuration, a single file is sufficient to create a fully documented R package.
}
\details{
The package is specified through a list coming from an R script or configuration file.
The following elements control package generation.
\itemize{
	\item{name: }{The name of the pacakge}
	\item{files: }{R-files to be put into the package. If an R-file is used for the configuration,
		it will automatically be include. This allows package definition through a single R-file.}
	\item{instFiles: }{Other files to be installed. This is a list, the names of which specify
		sub-folders in the \code{inst} sub-directory of the package. Values are character vectors
		specifying files to be put there.}
}
