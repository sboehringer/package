\title{Create package from vector of source files and single configuration}
\usage{
createPackage(packageDesc, packagesDir = "~/src/Rpackages", dir = NULL,
  doInstall = FALSE, gitOptions = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{packageDesc}{path to the configuration file (R, extended plist format, json, yaml)
If an R-file is provided, it is sourced in a seperate environment and needs to define the variable
`packageDefinition`. This variable has to be a list which is further specified in the details below.
If a propertyList/JSON/YAML-file is provided, they have to parse into a list corresponding to
`packageDefinition`. Functions \code{propertyFromStringExt}, \code{read_json}, and \code{read_yaml} are
used for parsing, coming from packages \code{package}, \code{jsonlite}, and \code{yaml}.}

\item{doInstall}{flag to indicate whether the package should also be installed}

\item{packageDir}{folder in which the folder structure of the package is written}
}
\description{
This function creates a package dir, runs documentation generation using roxygen and optionally installs the package. It can also update via git and manage version numbers. In a minimal configuration, a single file is sufficient to create a fully documented R package.
