#' Create packages from R-code directly
#'
#' @details
#' This package simplifies package generation by automating the use of `devtools` and `roxygen`. It also makes the development workflow more efficient by allowing ad-hoc development of packages.
#' This package allows you to create a fully-fledged R-package from a single R-file reducing the added work-load for maintaining a package to a minimum. Depending on the project, collections of files can be used and configuration can be seperated into a stand-alone configuration file, providing full flexibility. It can also handle git interaction.
