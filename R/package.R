#' This is package `package`.
#'
#' This package allows you to create a fully-fledged R-package from a single R-file reducing the added work-load for maintaining a package to a minimum. Depending on the project, collections of files can be used and configuration can be seperated into a stand-alone cofiguration file, providing full flexibility.
